# Portfolio
This will be my portfolio. Which will be showcasing all of my projects and work that I did in C, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The website will be up to date so in the future when I learn more languages. I can add more projects that I did for my coding languages that I learned so I can keep building up my portfolio.
